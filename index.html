                    Cyclosis or cytoplasmic streaming is the vital process in plant cell. It is driven by organells-associated myosin motors moving along actin filament bundles. Streaming may play a significant role in promoting the exchange of molecules and proteins across organelle membranes. This process is also responsible for mobility of ER, Golgi complex, peroxisomes, mitochondria and chloroplasts. In addition, the entire vacuolar fluid is set in motion by forces generated in the cytoplasm. The stirring of vacuolar fluid by streaming may also enhance mixing within a given cell, enabling the mobilization of metabolites and contributing to physiological homeostasis. Furthermore, there are many researches on factors influencing the cyclosis. For instance, cytoplasmic streaming is inhibited by calcium ion and cytochalasin B4. Light also has an effect on cyclosis.

                    Chloroplast movement is the obvious process of cytoplasmic streaming which is important for plant surviving to locate the most appropriate position to absorb efficient light for photosynthesis. Chloroplasts have alternative ways to response to different light intensity. They move toward weak light irradiated area (accumulation response) to absorbs more light allowing efficient photosynthesis but move away from strong light when irradiated directly (avoidance response), avoiding absorb excess light lead to damage. Blue light receptor phototropin 2 (phot2) play role in avoidance from the strong light localized on the chloroplast envelop. Weak light-irradiated accumulation response is arranged by phot1 and phot2 localized on the plasma membrane. Movement is driven by chloroplast actin (cp-actin) filaments that must be polymerized by Chloroplast Unusual Positioning1 (CHUP1) at the front side of moving chloroplast.

                    Hydrilla leaf - It is a submerged, perennial aquatic plant. Hydrilla has small, green, pointed leaves. Leaves of hydrilla show cytoplasmic streaming and it helps in movement of substances and grow in whorls of four to eight around the stem. The leaf margins are distinctly saw toothed. Hydrilla's small leaves are strap-like and pointed.

                    Hydrilla is especially valuable to true vegetarians. It is used to provide complete nutrition, improves digestion, blood sugar control, increases endurance etc. Hydrilla produces tiny white flowers on long stamens. The leaves are green in color and translucent.
